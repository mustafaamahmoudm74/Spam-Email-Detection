This code implements a spam email detection model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The model is trained on a dataset of emails labeled as either spam or not spam (ham).
The key steps include data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training different machine learning classifiers.
The chosen classifiers are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting. 
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.
The initial step installs the necessary Python libraries using pip, including the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), WordCloud, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
